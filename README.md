Hello_World
=================

Learning how to work in github 

in 2015 one of my top 5 goals is to get to the point where I am able to read and write small pieces of code.  I don't have any specific language that I want to learn.  But by this time next year I will be developing small programs. 

It's now 2017 and still stuck on getting out of the starting blocks.
